# Weekly Visualisations

This repository is dedicated to creating a new chart in Python or R each week based on the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) datasets. This repo follows the mantra: 

> Use it or lose it!

... that even applies to basic data wrangling or visualisation skills.
